<h1 style="text-align: center;" class="my-link">Researchers Test Smart Surfaces to Improve Wireless Communication and Localization</h1>
<p class="para1">Researchers at UBC Okanagan are looking at ways to improve cell phone connectivity and localization abilities by examining "smart" surfaces that can bounce signals from a tower to customers to improve the link. A smart surface involves installing reflective elements on windows or panels on buildings in dense urban environments.

    The goal, says Dr. Anas Chaaban, is to improve wireless services for millions of Canadians. Currently, he says, there are more than 12,000 wireless antenna towers. And yet, a lack of cell service is a common problem.
    
    "The increasing use of mobile technologies across the world is necessitating research that unlocks potential new approaches within our existing infrastructure," says Dr. Chaaban, an Assistant Professor at UBC Okanagan's School of Engineering. "Even though cellphone towers line the rooftops of major cities, and handle the data and phone traffic of millions of Canadians each day, there are still gaps in service."
    
    Dr. Chaaban and his team at UBCO's Communication Theory Lab have developed transmission schemes that would incorporate reconfigurable intelligent surfaces -- smart surfaces -- throughout urban centres to serve as reflectors within existing wireless networks.
    
    A reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) is a panel of many individual reflective elements, each of which can modify an incoming signal and reflect it. This modification can be controlled with an electrical signal, which enables the RIS to improve the connection or generate signals that are useful for locating users in the network.
    
    The researchers developed a new localization system where an RIS can work as a satellite to improve accuracy. By making a surface smart, it can bounce signals to cell phones which in turn can use these signals to generate an accurate estimate of location, he says. An accurate location estimate is not only useful for location services but also to improve transmission from the tower to the phone using optimized location-aware transmission schemes that also leverage the RIS.
    
    "Users never expect to have a call drop, and they also expect lightning-fast data speeds," he says. "But to accomplish this, the networks require constant updating."
    
    The researchers tested their theory using multiple modulated RISs that allow for the simultaneous localization of multiple users with low complexity for each RIS. They also developed and tested RIS-enabled transmission schemes that outperform existing schemes.
    
    "We simulated the proposed localization protocol and demonstrated its effectiveness in an urban micro-cell street canyon scenario as an example," he explains. "And the protocol works for multiple users simultaneously. Even in areas with intermittent service, data can be shared and users can be located and enjoy a reliable connection."</p><br>

    <p class="para1">New artificial intelligence technology being developed by engineers at Brigham Young University could significantly cut down on the time and cost that goes into film study for Super Bowl-bound teams (and all NFL and college football teams), while also enhancing game strategy by harnessing the power of big data.

        BYU professor D.J. Lee, master's student Jacob Newman and Ph.D. students Andrew Sumsion and Shad Torrie are using AI to automate the time-consuming process of analyzing and annotating game footage manually. Using deep learning and computer vision, the researchers have created an algorithm that can consistently locate and label players from game film and determine the formation of the offensive team -- a process that can demand the time of a slew of video assistants.
        
        "We were having a conversation about this and realized, whoa, we could probably teach an algorithm to do this," said Lee, a professor of electrical and computer engineering. "So we set up a meeting with BYU Football to learn their process and immediately knew, yeah, we can do this a lot faster."
        
        While still early in the research, the team has already obtained better than 90% accuracy on player detection and labeling with their algorithm, along with 85% accuracy on determining formations. They believe the technology could eventually eliminate the need for the inefficient and tedious practice of manual annotation and analysis of recorded video used by NFL and college teams.
        
        Lee and Newman first looked at real game footage provided by BYU's football team. As they started to analyze it, they realized they needed some additional angles to properly train their algorithm. So they bought a copy of Madden 2020, which shows the field from above and behind the offense, and manually labeled 1,000 images and videos from the game.
        
        They used those images to train a deep-learning algorithm to locate the players, which then feeds into a Residual Network framework to determine what position the players are playing. Finally, their neural network uses the location and position information to determine what formation (of more than 25 formations) the offense is using -- anything from the Pistol Bunch TE to the I Form H Slot Open.
        
        Lee said the algorithm can accurately identify formations 99.5% when the player location and labeling information is correct. The I Formation, where four players are lined up one in front of the next -- center, quarterback, fullback and running back -- proved to be one of the most challenging formations to identify.
        
        Lee and Newman said the AI system could also have applications in other sports. For example, in baseball it could locate player positions on the field and identify common patterns to assist teams in refining how they defend against certain batters. Or it could be used to locate soccer players to help determine more efficient and effective formations.
        
        "Once you have this data there will be a lot more you can do with it; you can take it to the next level," Lee said. "Big data can help us know the strategies of this team, or the tendencies of that coach. It could help you know if they are likely to go for it on 4th Down and 2 or if they will punt. The idea of using AI for sports is really cool, and if we can give them even 1% of an advantage, it will be worth it."</p>
